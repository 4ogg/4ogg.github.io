    <h1>Why a blog?</h1>
    <p>
	You might be thinking, “Why on Earth is he starting a blog? This ‘Normie’ guy sure must think pretty highly of himself.” Of course, you’re correct with that assertion – but that’s not the primary reason. I have spent the past two years running a social hangout <a href="https://discord.gg/invite/qdxhFwT3Tr" target="_blank">Discord server</a> vaguely masquerading as a modding community for the latest crop of Final Fantasy 7 games. In those two years, I’ve taken to being more and more vocal about certain issues and events happening in the world. We’ve had some fantastic conversations about these things, but they always end up getting pushed back into the chat history and forgotten as time goes on.
	</br>
	</br>
	To this end, I’ve decided to make a place for me to post more longform writing that would be almost entirely out of place anywhere else. I’ve tried my hand posting on other websites before, but I typically find myself woefully out of place among the regular denizens. As such, instead of creating an X account and flooding timelines with novels, I just threw together a basic website for myself.
	</br>
	</br>
	I don’t expect anyone to read these posts, at least not religiously. This serves more as a place for me to catalog my thoughts and have them in an easily accessible form. I considered setting up a mailing list for any interested parties, but that seems kind of lame. You can just check the site once in a while if you truly care.
